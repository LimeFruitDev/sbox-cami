# Common Admin Mod Interface
This is an implementation of the renowned Garry's Mod library [CAMI](https://github.com/glua/CAMI) for s&box.

It is not 1:1 with the Garry's Mod version, many things having been adapted to better fit the environment we work in. For example, default usergroups have been completely removed (and as such also Privilege::MinAccess).

The majority of this is still a work-in-progress:
* Access callbacks have not been implemented at all.
* Documentation is incomplete, especially instructions on using this library.
* This needs to be tested in a working environment.

Contributions are highly welcome.
