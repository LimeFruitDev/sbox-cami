For example, default usergroups have been completely removed (and as such also Privilege::MinAccess).\n\nThe majority of this is still a work-in-progress:\n* Access callbacks have not been implemented at all.\n* Documentation is incomplete, especially instructions on using this library.\n* This needs to be tested in a working environment.\n\nContributions are highly welcome.",
